# room-vue
I decided to learn a new JavaScript framework, Vue.js, in which to complete this project. I did not have much experience with any JavaScript frameworks prior to this project, so I decided it would be a good challenge and learning experience. This app searches through the TMDB API for movie details and returns that data to the user based on search.
